README file for the Baer-Nunziato ADER-WENO MGFM algorithm.

These files have been migrated over from a private SVN, please contact me if anything is missing.

Compile all files using 'g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp -o file_name -O2 -larmadillo' replacing file_name with the name of the file.

The latest version of Armadillo is required to compile, found at :

http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html

The modified code folder contains various modifications of the code used to simulate the results contained within the thesis. The Baer_Nunziato.cpp code within the main folder contains the basic code for simulating a strong compaction around a cylinder.

For more information about the methods or types of problems that can be solved with this code, please read the Documentation.pdf file.

Simulation setups are given in the Test_problems folder, each one is equivalent to the corresponding problem given within the Documentation.pdf file

The Development_files folder containts files in matlab used to develop the theory behind the code, for example the matrix decompositions needed to solve the Baer-Nunziato equations
